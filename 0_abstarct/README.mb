In this tutorial we are going to interface a 4x2 (8 key) touch keypad with ATMEGA32A microcontroller.
We all know keypad is one of the most important input devices used in electronics engineering.
This module does not have actual keys, but have specially designed capacitive metal pads, and these pads are very sensitive. 
So when a person gets in contact with one of the pads, there will a capacitive change in the corresponding loop,
and this change will be sensed by the control electronic in the module. As a response to the touch the corresponding pad output pin goes high.
